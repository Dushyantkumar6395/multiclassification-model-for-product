# Codemonk Machine Learning Intern Assignment

## Philosophy

The goal of this challenge is to showcase your coding ability, analytical thinking, and system-building capability and last but not least demonstration of strong Data Science skills.

## Values

- We use Python programming language extensively
- We love getting rich insights from data and always do detailed EDA
- We prefer Pytorch but you can still use Keras or Tensorflow
- We highly value code cleanliness, re-usability, structure and proper documentation.

## Time Limit

Complete this challenge within 1 day of receiving it.

## The Challenge

### **Task:**

Download the following dataset:

**Dataset link**: [Fashion Product Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-dataset)

Using the dataset, carry out the following tasks:

1. **Detailed EDA**
2. Given an image input, build a deep learning-based model that can predict the following outputs:
   - Color of product
   - Type of product (T-shirt, shoes, etc.)
   - Preferable season to use this product
   - Gender (Men, Women, Unisex)
3. Once you build the model, take a few sample screenshots of fashion products from the Amazon website and use your model to predict the result.

### **Bonus Points** ðŸŽ¯

1. If you can create an **API script** for serving the model.
2. Create **Streamlit** or any other **GUI-based application** for demonstration.

---

### **Note:**

1. You can create a notebook in **Kaggle** and train the model using **GPU compute**. After training, download the Jupyter Notebook. Depending on the model size, use **Google Drive or another storage** for saving the trained model.
2. You can make **valid assumptions** to complete the task efficiently, but make sure you write them explicitly in the notebook.
3. The **Jupyter Notebook, trained model link, and all necessary files** should be uploaded to **GitHub or GitLab**.

---

## **Submission Instructions:**

When you are done:

1. Make a **public GitHub or GitLab repository** and upload all task files.
2. Ensure that we can **run the code without issues**.
3. Send us a quick email to let us know once you're done.
